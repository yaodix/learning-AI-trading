## Understanding Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This process helps in understanding and summarizing data attributes using visual tools.


### Purpose of EDA:

* **Understand Data Structure:**
  * Use histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots to reveal data patterns and trends.
* **Detect Anomalies & Patterns:**
  * Identify misleading data points and significant patterns for better analysis.
* **Validate Assumptions:**
  * Check if data meets model assumptions, like normal distribution.


## Understanding Descriptive Statistics in EDA

### What Are Descriptive Statistics?

* **Descriptive Statistics** : Summarize data features into single numbers.
* **Example** : Average (mean) of a set of numbers.

### Common Descriptive Measures:

* **Mean** :
* Calculate by summing data points and dividing by the total number.
* **Note** : Can be skewed by extreme values (outliers).
* **Median** :
* Represents the middle value when data is ordered.
* Less affected by outliers, providing a more accurate center.
* **Variance** :
* Measures data spread by averaging squared deviations from the mean.
* **Standard Deviation** :
* Square root of variance, indicating data's average distance from the mean. Useful for assessing risk levels.
